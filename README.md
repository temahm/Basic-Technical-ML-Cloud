# Basic-Technical-ML-Cloud
Basic Operations code for ML, LLMs, Cloud, CI/CD, Scaling, and etcetera

##This is a Repositiry with basic operations code that can easily be copied/pasted in projects for moving fordward fast
## The goal is to keep this code updated with changes from vendors to all research can be reused
## The code found here, in general is for:

* ML (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning, and its different strategies/algorithms)
* LLMs (ChatGPT, LangChain, Graph, Prompt Engineering, etcetera)
* APIs (some common and useful APIs for Vendirs, Databases, Data Warehouses, Data providers, and Etcetera)  
* Cloud (Process Automation, Containerization, Etcetera)
* CI/CD (Process Automation)
* Scaling (Process Automation, Orchestration, etcetera)
